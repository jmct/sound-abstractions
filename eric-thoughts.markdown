If you think about it hard and long enough, there's no abstraction.
There's form, and there's aesthetics of the form, and there's the content.
The _tools_ are the abstractions.
Composers will choose their tools to better 'get at' the core idea.

Some abstractions:

  * Pitch
  * Scale
  * Mode
  * Harmonic Style
  * Rhythmic Discipline
  * Sequencers
    - Not every step has to have the same length, but it can keep a periodic rhythm (8 steps but doing 7/8).

Structuralism in the humanities.

Composer pitfall:
  Folks sometimes focus too much on the abstraction they know (CPE harmony), and miss out on opportunities in their creation.

  Think of how a steering wheel and pedal are good for some things, but imagine if the steering wheel controlled acceleration
  and the pedal controlled steering.


Abstraction isn't always the best! Sometimes you only know the abstraction after you've done the thing.

Assemblage (Philosophy): Things have multiple parts and things can also have more than one purpose, many of them are incidental!
